# KGen

Quickly bootstrap a modern Node.js project with extensionable templates.

## Get started

To use KGen, install it globally with `npm`:

```bash
$ npm i -g @kgen/cli
```

Then you can run it with command `kgen`:

```bash
$ kgen gen <template>
```

Where `<template>` is the template name you wanted to generate. Typcially, it is in the format `<owner>/<repo>`, for example `samzhangjy/vanilla`.
